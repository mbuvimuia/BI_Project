The project aims to enhance the loan management process within the SACCO (Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization) by leveraging data-driven insights and technology advancements. The focus is on optimising loan application procedures, improving employee knowledge and satisfaction, and driving business growth through increased loan portfolio and revenue.To achieve these objectives, the project employs a comprehensive approach that includes several key initiatives. First, employee understanding of the SACCO's products and services is prioritised through targeted training programs and knowledge-building activities. This empowers employees to effectively communicate and educate customers about the available loan offerings. Furthermore, employee satisfaction is closely monitored and improved by implementing feedback mechanisms and introducing initiatives to enhance the working environment. This fosters a positive organisational culture and promotes employee engagement, leading to better customer service and increased customer retention. The project also emphasises the importance of training and development, with a specific focus on increasing the number of employees participating in relevant programs. This ensures that employees stay updated with industry trends, regulations, and best practices, enabling them to deliver high-quality loan services and support.In addition, the project aims to streamline the loan application process to provide a seamless and efficient experience for borrowers. The average time taken to complete a loan application is closely monitored and optimised, reducing waiting times and enhancing customer satisfaction. To mitigate loan application abandonment, the project focuses on identifying and addressing pain points that lead to drop-offs. By monitoring the loan application abandonment rate, necessary improvements can be made to streamline the process and improve conversion rates. Lastly, the project aims to drive business growth by increasing the number of new loan applications received and subsequently boosting revenue. This is achieved through targeted marketing efforts, innovative loan products, and efficient loan management practices. By closely tracking the number of new loan applications and revenue growth, the project ensures continuous monitoring of business performance. Overall, the project combines technological advancements, data analytics, employee development, and customer-centric strategies to optimise the loan management process, enhance employee satisfaction, and drive business growth within the SACCO.
